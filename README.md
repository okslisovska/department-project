# department-project
This Python project is just a simple web application created for learning purposes.
Mainly for practicing the skills on the following technologies:
 Flask, SQLAlchemy, flask-migrate, unittest, Travis-CI, Git

**Department-project** consists of two main parts:
- The first one is an *Application* for managing information about departments.
The home page shows all departments with the salary average for each. Links are directing to view lists of employees for each department. The employee is represented by first name, last name and salary amount. There is also a page describing the API endpoints.
  

- The second part is a RESTfull *Web service* providing API for CRUD operations.
This Web service is used by the Application for storing data and reading from the database.

The application has been deployed to [Heroku.](https://department-project.herokuapp.com/)
